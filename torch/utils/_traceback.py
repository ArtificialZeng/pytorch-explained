# This file contains utilities for ensuring dynamically compile()'d
# code fragments display their line numbers in backtraces.
#
# The constraints:
#
# - We don't have control over the user exception printer (in particular,
#   we cannot assume the linecache trick will work, c.f.
#   https://stackoverflow.com/q/50515651/23845 )
#
# - We don't want to create temporary files every time we compile()
#   some code; file creation should happen lazily only at exception
#   time.  Arguably, you *should* be willing to write out your
#   generated Python code to file system, but in some situations
#   (esp. library code) it would violate user expectation to write
#   to the file system, so we try to avoid it.  In particular, we'd
#   like to keep the files around, so users can open up the files
#   mentioned in the trace; if the file is invisible, we want to
#   avoid clogging up the filesystem.
#
#   If this is not a constraint for you, there is a substantially simpler
#   way to implement the functionality in this PR: instead of using
#   eval/exec directly, just always write a Python file to filesystem
#   and compile that.
#
# - You have control over a context where the compiled code will get
#   executed, so that we can interpose while the stack is unwinding
#   (otherwise, we have no way to interpose on the exception printing
#   process.)
#
# There are two things you have to do to make use of the utilities here:
#
# - When you compile your source code, you must save its string source
#   in its f_globals under the magic name "__compile_source__"
#
# - Before running the compiled code, enter the
#   report_compile_source_on_error() context manager.

                # frames that were generated from exec/eval so that they
                # point to a temporary file that has the actual line
                # information, so Python's default error printer can print
                # useful line information on it.

                # Writing out the temporary file is easy.  But overwriting
                # co_filename is not!  You can't modify the code object

                # a traceback with entirely new frames from scratch, so that's
                # what we do.  But there's another problem, which is how to
                # make the frame?

                # The black magic is we make a frankenstein frame and code

                # that it will print properly under traceback and the default
                # error printer, but IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FRAME (you
                # couldn't, e.g., execute its code with different variables
                # and expect it to work.)
